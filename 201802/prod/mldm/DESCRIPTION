Description: Multivariate binary data with multiple binary responses and one or 
    more explanatory variable(s), are often collected in emperical 
    sciences such as psychology, medicine, criminiology, epidemiology, and life 
    sciences. The mldm package enables us to fit a Multivariate Logistic Distance (MLD) model 
    on such type of data. 
    Dimension reduction as a form of regularization is possible in the MLD model.
    The reduction in dimension makes the distance model more preferred than the 
    existing marginal models since less parameters are estimated. The MLD model can 
    be used for comparing dimensional structure of the data.
