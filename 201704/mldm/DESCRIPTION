Description: Multivariate binary data, in which there are multiple binary outcome 
    variables and one or more predictor variable(s), are often collected in emperical 
    sciences such as psychology, medicine, criminiology, epidemiology, and life 
    sciences. The mldm package fits a logistic distance models on such data. The model
    is a family of marginal models (like the standard and extended GEE methods). 
    Dimension reduction as a form of regularization, is possible in the distance model.
    Such a reduction makes the distance model more preferred compared to the existing 
    marginal models since less parameters need to be estimated. The distance model can 
	be used for comparing factorial structure of the data.
